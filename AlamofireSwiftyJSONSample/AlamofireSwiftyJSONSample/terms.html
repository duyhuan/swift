        within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.<br/><br/>

For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms and Conditions, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with MyPets exclusively in a state or federal court located in Jackson, Mississippi, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Hinds County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.<br/><br/> 
            
            If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. MyPets failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.

You will not assign the Terms and Conditions or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of MyPets. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of MyPets will be null and void. MyPets may assign these Terms and Conditions or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
